## SUBTOPIC: Wordcount using Flink
## Prerequisites
* Apache Flink 
* Pip
* Python(3.6.0 to 3.8.0 version)

## Installation of Python
If any other versions of python are previously installed in your system use the below command to uninstall
```
choco uninstall python
```
To install python of a specific version use the below command
```
choco install python version=3.8.0
```
## Installation steps for PyFlink

The version of python should be (3.5, 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8) for PyFlink. Please run the following command to make sure that it meets the requirements:
```
$ python --version
```
Use the below command to install apache-flink 
```
$ python -m pip install apache-flink 
```
You can also build PyFlink from source by following the development guide.

Note Starting from Flink 1.11, itâ€™s also supported to run PyFlink jobs locally on Windows and so you could develop and debug PyFlink jobs on Windows.

## Code for wordcount using pyflink:

```
import logging
import os
import shutil
import sys
import tempfile

from flink.plan.Environment import get_environment
from flink.functions.GroupReduceFunction import GroupReduceFunction

class Adder(GroupReduceFunction):
  def reduce(self, iterator, collector):
    count, word = iterator.next()
    count += sum([x[0] for x in iterator])
    collector.collect((count, word))

env = get_environment()
data = env.from_elements("Who's there?",
 "I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?")

data \
  .flat_map(lambda x, c: [(1, word) for word in x.lower().split()]) \
  .group_by(1) \
  .reduce_group(Adder(), combinable=True) \
  .output()

env.execute(local=True)

# To read data from files

env = get_environment()
text = env.read_text("file:///path/to/file")
# Transformations to the new dataset

data.map(lambda x: x*2)

# Dataset that needs to be written to disk.Can call one of these methods on DataSet:

data.write_text("<file-path>", WriteMode=Constants.NO_OVERWRITE)
write_csv("<file-path>", line_delimiter='\n', field_delimiter=',', write_mode=Constants.NO_OVERWRITE)
output()
```
### Output: 

* I have run this code in Flink in Local Machine iam getting Module_not found error iam trying to resolve it.I will update it once it gets resolved.
